#1. Github

First, you need an account : 

Sign up for Github here: https://github.com/ 

Once you have created your account you want to create a repository

Creating a repository on Github: 

Repositories store all the necessary components of a single project. 
To create a repository: 

1. In the upper-right corner of the GitHub webpage, use the drop-down menu that has the + sign, and select New repository.
2. In the Repository name box, enter the name of your repository.
3. In the Description box, write a description of the repository.
4. Check the box that says Add a README file.
5. Click Create repository.

#2. Creating a branch

Branching allows you to work on different versions of the same project. There is a default main branch, instead of directly making changes to the main branch, we can separately work on changes that can be discussed with the team or yourself before merging the new changes into the main branch.

To create a branch: 

1. On the main page of your repository, Click the drop-down at the top of the file list that says Master or Main.
2. Type a branch name, edits, into the text box.
3. Click Create branch: edits from main.

Now there is a new branch identical to the main branch, which you will make changes there before officially committing the changes to the main branch.


Committing changes 
To commit changes you can use either the command line, or you may use Webstorm’s integrated Version Control Tools. 


Opening a pull request

The new ‘edits’ branch is just a copy of the main branch. Once you edit the branch you must save those changes. That process is called commit, each commit includes a commit message which documents the changes you’ve made to the project. Commits allow people to review the history of changes to the file and help with collaboration.

Click the README.md file.
Click the pen icon to edit the file.
In the editor, write a bit about yourself.
In the Commit changes box, write a commit message that describes your changes.
Click Commit changes.
