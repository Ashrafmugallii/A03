#1. Github

First, you need an account : 

Sign up for Github here: https://github.com/ 

Once you have created your account you want to create a repository. 
Repositories store all the necessary components of a single project. 
 
To create a repository:

#Creating a branch

Branching allows you to work on different versions of the same project. There is a default main branch, instead of directly making changes to the main branch, we can separately work on changes that can be discussed with the team or yourself before merging the new changes into the main branch.

To create a branch: 

1. On the main page of your repository, Click the drop-down at the top left of your repository that says Master or Main.
2. You should see your branches and a textbox that says switch branches/tags
3. Enter the name of the new branch
4. Click Create branch: branch name from main

#Committing changes 

Any saved changes to your project is called a commit. 
You may either commit changes using the command line, or you may use Webstormâ€™s built-in Version Control Tools. 

1. Open your readme.md file and make some edits
2. when you are done, scroll to the bottom and you will see a commit changes box
3. Briefly describe the changes you've made to your file.
4. Once you are done click commit changes, These changes are commited to the branch you just created


#Opening a pull request

Pull requests are for your team members to review your changes and make a decision before merging into the main branch. You may open a pull request as soon as you make your first commit. Since you have already created a new branch and made edits to it, You are ready to open a pull request.

To Open a pull request

1. Click the tab that says "Pull requests" On your repository page
2. Click on New pull request
3. Click on the branch you created to compare it to the original 
4. Review the changes made and determine wether or not you want to keep them
5. Click Create Pull request
6. Give the pull request a name and a description
7. finally click create pull request

From there, the team members you are working with, or yourself, can review your edits and leave some thoughts.

#Merging pull requests

Merging allows you to combine the changes you have made to the original main branch

1. Click on Merge pull request 
2. Confirm Merge
3. Delete the branch

Now all the new changes are part of the main branch.
